### About the project
In this project I learned a different architecture of how to make an API. In addition to tinkering with Docker and EF.

### appsettings
To run the project it is necessary to create an "appsettings.Development.json" where it is necessary to have a ConnectionString and inside it an IWantDb.
Or adjust connection string in Program.cs
